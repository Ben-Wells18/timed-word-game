# timed-word-game
A game built using vanilla Java script that tests the players ability to type words quickly.
# How to use
Just simply open the index file, the game will run using vanilla Java script and does not require any additional plugins. The user can simply select a difficulty setting and begin typing. The words are selected from a predetermined array and are displayed randomly.
# Changes
Any changes or improvements are welcome, I am looking to improve the UI as it is a bit dull at the moment.
